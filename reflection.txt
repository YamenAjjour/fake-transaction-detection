## Summary
This is a classifier to detect transactions on fake products.
- I extracted as features the average price and the lenght of the description of the product.
- I would have done more exploratory data analysis to explore more features.

## What would I have done differently
- I would have developed some basic features based on the product description. For example, one could extract n-grams.
- I would have done more thorough hyper-parameter optimization currently I did only a grid search. One could use Optuna
to explore better hyper-parameters. Of-course the size of features would have been a hyper-parameter
 - I would have gone beyond random forest to other clasifiers (SVM). Of-course given mroe time, I would have created
 an ensemble where one of the classifier can be an instruction-fine tuned LLM
